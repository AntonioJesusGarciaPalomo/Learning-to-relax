# Learning-to-relax
Optimal selection for combinatorial optimization QUBO formulations relaxation parameters is crucial to get a good solver performance. Here a deep-learning model is constructed in order to predict solution quality provided from the solver, and relaxation paramater optimization is perfomed with that. Classical simulated annealing algorithm is implemented to solve TSP and generate the required data.
